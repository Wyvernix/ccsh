Brandon: I primarily used the C programming documentation provided by
the man-pages project in the Linux system. Available online here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/
Extra credit: the program will determine the user’s name and home
directory in order to display a prompt relative to the user’s home
directory. This will change if the user changes into a directory
outside of the user’s home directory.
Another feature is in the ‘CD’ directive. If the user runs the ‘cd’
command without any parameters, the shell will move to the user’s home
directory.
